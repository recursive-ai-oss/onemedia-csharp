# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Opening an MP4/MOV or Matroska file is cheaper: the registry's first look at the file is handed to the reader instead of being read again, a movie box of up to 128 KiB is read in one request and parsed and table-read from memory, and Matroska answers buffered header peeks, payload reads and skips without an asynchronous method. On the 4.38 GB movie-box-last file a probe reads 91,892 bytes in 31 reads (was 124,660 in 32); on the 4.45 GB Matroska file it reads one 4 KiB block (was 36,864 bytes in 2 reads).
- Reading one track of an interleaved MP4 reads each chunk in one request instead of a 4, 8, 16 KiB climb.
- The EBML CRC-32 uses eight tables, eight bytes at a time.

### Added

- `MediaFile.Tags`, `CaptureTime`, `Location`, `Device`, `Rotation`, `Native[...]` and `ReadMetadataAsync`, and tags and facts in `onemedia info` (text and `--json`).
- `MediaFile.ContainerDuration`, `TracksDuration` and `ExactDuration`; `Duration` follows the longest track.
- Matroska: zlib-compressed frames are inflated on read; `OutputSamplingFrequency` is the audio rate; `V_MS/VFW/FOURCC` tracks are named by their FourCC.
- ISO: QuickTime packetised audio (IMA 4:1 and similar) is joined per chunk; the QuickTime sound layout is read from the data; AMR is mono at its codec rate; QuickTime `text` entries are timed text; `tapt`, `gmhd`, `hinf` and `hnti` are containers; a video size of 0 is taken from the sequence parameter set.

- Repository skeleton: core package `RecursiveAI.OneMedia`, audio adapter `RecursiveAI.OneMedia.Audio`, the `onemedia` tool, tests, NativeAOT and browser-WebAssembly smoke apps.
- Byte sources: memory, file, seekable stream, caller-supplied ranged reads and forward-only streams, plus an observer hook for counting reads.
- `MediaTime` (exact rational time with explicit rounding), `MediaLimits`, typed defects and exceptions.
- Content-based format sniffing and an explicit format registry; sniffers for ISO base media files, EBML (Matroska/WebM) and the other container and stream signatures.
- The track and packet model, demuxer interfaces with an allocation-free pull path, and the structure-node contract.
- `Media.Open` / `MediaFile` happy path, the `onemedia info` command, and the audio adapter: tracks as OneAudio packet sources, OneAudio container registrations for MP4 and Matroska, and `Decode()`.
